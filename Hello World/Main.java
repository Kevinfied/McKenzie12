/*
Java is an object orientated programming language. This means that our programs are organized into classes and objects.
Java is also device-independent. WIth languages like C, you need to compile your program for the machine that your program
is running on.

Java is statically-typed language. This means ALL variables need a type, and they can only store values of that type.

    public static void main(String[] args) {

/*
Class Main - ALL programs are also classes. In Replit, class must be Main.
main - This is a method (function in a class).
in your Main class, you should have a main method. The main method always gets ran first.
public - You can make variables amd methods public or private.

Static - "belongs to the class".

void - In Java, you must declare what type your method will return. void means that it does not return anything.

String[] args - We can pass in parameters to our program when we run it. This is most common when we run from the
command line.

System.out.println() - print, and add a newline character.
